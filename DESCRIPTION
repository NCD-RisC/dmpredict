Description: This package provides a function that applies the prediction
    equations developed in "NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC). Nature
    Medicine 2024; 29:2885-2901" that convert FPG to probability of having
    HbA1c ≥6.5% and convert HbA1c to probability of having FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L.
